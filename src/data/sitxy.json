    "intro":"By far the most popular, most accessible, and cheapest build option available. Its compact setup and small number of keys are perfect for gamers. As gamers are mostly concerned with alphanumeric keys, they don't lose a lot of functionality by parting ways with the numpad, function, arrow, and home/print cluster. While the numpad is comprised of numeric keys, it doesn't benefit gamers, the numeric keys above the alphas are much quicker to access. The compactness of 60% keyboards and the accessibility to bluetooth allows for easy pick up and go. The best part about 60% keyboards is they don't comprimise on key size, just the keys available. A seasoned typist wouldn't have a problem picking up this keyboard to write their next task. Finally, and arguably the most important thing is, 60% keyboards just look really cool."
